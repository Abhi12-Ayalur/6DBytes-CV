# image-recognition
Just a few experimental image-recognition files that help capture and track an object through color and corner recognition, along with some centroid and contour recognition features. End-goal is to broadcast (x,y) coordinates of object to external IoT device and receive information. 
Written in Python, can run in Python 2 or 3. 
Special thanks to PyImageSearch.com and the OpenCV documentation for use of their tutorials and documentation.
